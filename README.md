### Life in 64 bit. --- Computer Scientist in training! ---

- I am busy self-teaching C++ because I want to learn Computer Science, not just development TOOLS.
- I enjoy Web Development as well, and am also working on bettering my understanding of UI/UX design for both my Web and Native software solutions.

- When not coding, I work on Blender for its multiple uses (Game Assets, 3D printing, Architecture, etc), as well as 2D digital art for creating assets for my personal projects and websites.
